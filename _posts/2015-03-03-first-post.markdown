So finally I found time to insert a blog in my jekyll site. Hopefully I'm able to use it over the time posting about my life, tech things, maybe some ember.js related Posts, because I loved them myself when I started. Because their are topics you can't cover in a normal documentation but they should be covered somewhere :D

Thanks to *Dirk Fabisch* for his theme [Mediator]('https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator') which I'm using here.

In advanced I would like to ask for patience regarding my written english skills as I'm not a native speaker.
